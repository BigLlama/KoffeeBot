KoffeeBot is a project I founded in late October of 2021. 
At that time I was a first-year (now second-year) for a Software Engineering degree. 
I took upon this project as a fun way to practice my newly learned skills and have been doing it even to this day.

KoffeeBot is a multifunctional discord bot designed to do numerous tasks, but for the most part; to entertain.

**KoffeeBot's categories include:**
